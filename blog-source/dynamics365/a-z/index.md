## Overview

Welcome to my blog series, Dynamics 365 CE: From A-Z! In this collection, I'll explore Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement thoroughly, covering features and techniques from every letter of the alphabet. My goal is not only to share what I've learned from my daily work but also to uncover new insights and hidden gems along the way.

Each week, Iâ€™ll aim to publish a new post highlighting a specific aspect or feature of Dynamics 365 CE, working my way systematically from A to Z. Hopefully this will serve as a resource for those wanting to learn D365 as well as providing some value for seasoned developers.

## About Me

I'm a software developer at TrueNorthIT, where we specialize in building robust Dynamics 365 CE solutions. Microsoft may be pushing Low Code recently, but I'm all about pushing Dynamics 365 to its limits with FULL CODE. Developing plugins, creating complex web resources, and integrating seamlessly with Azure services are my forte. I thrive on pushing the boundaries of what's possible while staying on the right side of supported!

Join me on this alphabetical adventure as we explore, discover, and innovate within Dynamics 365 CE!
